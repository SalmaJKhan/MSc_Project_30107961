**Applications of AI in IVF â€” Embryo Classification: AI Architect Design Investigation and Comparative Study**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a robust AI-based tool for classifying embryo images in the context of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatments. By leveraging various machine learning and deep learning techniques, we investigate and compare the performance of different AI architectures for classifying 2,445 embryo images into "silver" and "gold" standards. The goal is to explore both traditional machine learning methods (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) and advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., CNN, ResNet-50, DenseNet-201, VGG16, InceptionV3, Xception) to determine the most accurate model for embryo classification.

**Project Components**

**1. Google Colab Code**
The code used for model training, testing, and evaluation is provided in the Google_Colab_Code.ipynb file.
This includes the preprocessing steps, model implementations, and comparisons between different AI architectures.

**2. Project Report**
The detailed report of the project is available in the Report.pdf file.
It covers the methodology, data analysis, results, and key findings from the comparative study of the AI architectures.

**3. Prototype Test Run [Video]**
A video demonstration of the working prototype can be found in the Prototype Test Run.mp4 file.
This showcases how the AI tool classifies embryo images and the user interface for interacting with the system.

**4. PPT Presentation for VIVA**
The VIVA_Presentation.pptx file contains the PowerPoint slides for the project's VIVA defense. It provides an overview of the project, key challenges, and final results.

**AI Architectures Investigated**

**Traditional Machine Learning Models:**
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests

**Deep Learning Models:**
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
